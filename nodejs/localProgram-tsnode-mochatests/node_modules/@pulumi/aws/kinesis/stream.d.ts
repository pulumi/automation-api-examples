import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
/**
 * Provides a Kinesis Stream resource. Amazon Kinesis is a managed service that
 * scales elastically for real-time processing of streaming big data.
 *
 * For more details, see the [Amazon Kinesis Documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/kinesis/).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const testStream = new aws.kinesis.Stream("test_stream", {
 *     retentionPeriod: 48,
 *     shardCount: 1,
 *     shardLevelMetrics: [
 *         "IncomingBytes",
 *         "OutgoingBytes",
 *     ],
 *     tags: {
 *         Environment: "test",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Kinesis Streams can be imported using the `name`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:kinesis/stream:Stream test_stream kinesis-test
 * ```
