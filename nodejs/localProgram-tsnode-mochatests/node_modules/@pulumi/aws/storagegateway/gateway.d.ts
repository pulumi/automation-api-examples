/**
 * Manages an AWS Storage Gateway file, tape, or volume gateway in the provider region.
 *
 * > NOTE: The Storage Gateway API requires the gateway to be connected to properly return information after activation. If you are receiving `The specified gateway is not connected` errors during resource creation (gateway activation), ensure your gateway instance meets the [Storage Gateway requirements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/Requirements.html).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### File Gateway
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.storagegateway.Gateway("example", {
 *     gatewayIpAddress: "1.2.3.4",
 *     gatewayName: "example",
 *     gatewayTimezone: "GMT",
 *     gatewayType: "FILE_S3",
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Tape Gateway
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.storagegateway.Gateway("example", {
 *     gatewayIpAddress: "1.2.3.4",
 *     gatewayName: "example",
 *     gatewayTimezone: "GMT",
 *     gatewayType: "VTL",
 *     mediumChangerType: "AWS-Gateway-VTL",
 *     tapeDriveType: "IBM-ULT3580-TD5",
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Volume Gateway (Cached)
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.storagegateway.Gateway("example", {
 *     gatewayIpAddress: "1.2.3.4",
 *     gatewayName: "example",
 *     gatewayTimezone: "GMT",
 *     gatewayType: "CACHED",
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Volume Gateway (Stored)
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.storagegateway.Gateway("example", {
 *     gatewayIpAddress: "1.2.3.4",
 *     gatewayName: "example",
 *     gatewayTimezone: "GMT",
 *     gatewayType: "STORED",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * `aws_storagegateway_gateway` can be imported by using the gateway Amazon Resource Name (ARN), e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:storagegateway/gateway:Gateway example arn:aws:storagegateway:us-east-1:123456789012:gateway/sgw-12345678
 * ```
 *
 *  Certain resource arguments, like `gateway_ip_address` do not have a Storage Gateway API method for reading the information after creation, either omit the argument from the provider configuration or use `ignoreChanges` to hide the difference.
