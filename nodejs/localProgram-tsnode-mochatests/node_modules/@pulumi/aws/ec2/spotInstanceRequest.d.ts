/**
 * Provides an EC2 Spot Instance Request resource. This allows instances to be
 * requested on the spot market.
 *
 * By default this provider creates Spot Instance Requests with a `persistent` type,
 * which means that for the duration of their lifetime, AWS will launch an
 * instance with the configured details if and when the spot market will accept
 * the requested price.
 *
 * On destruction, this provider will make an attempt to terminate the associated Spot
 * Instance if there is one present.
 *
 * Spot Instances requests with a `one-time` type will close the spot request
 * when the instance is terminated either by the request being below the current spot
 * price availability or by a user.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** Because their behavior depends on the live status of the spot
 * market, Spot Instance Requests have a unique lifecycle that makes them behave
 * differently than other resources. Most importantly: there is __no
 * guarantee__ that a Spot Instance exists to fulfill the request at any given
 * point in time. See the [AWS Spot Instance
 * documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-spot-instances.html)
 * for more information.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * // Request a spot instance at $0.03
 * const cheapWorker = new aws.ec2.SpotInstanceRequest("cheap_worker", {
 *     ami: "ami-1234",
 *     instanceType: "c4.xlarge",
 *     spotPrice: "0.03",
 *     tags: {
 *         Name: "CheapWorker",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
