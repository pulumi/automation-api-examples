/**
 * Provides an AWS App Mesh gateway route resource.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.appmesh.GatewayRoute("example", {
 *     meshName: "example-service-mesh",
 *     virtualGatewayName: aws_appmesh_virtual_gateway.example.name,
 *     spec: {
 *         httpRoute: {
 *             action: {
 *                 target: {
 *                     virtualService: {
 *                         virtualServiceName: aws_appmesh_virtual_service.example.name,
 *                     },
 *                 },
 *             },
 *             match: {
 *                 prefix: "/",
 *             },
 *         },
 *     },
 *     tags: {
 *         Environment: "test",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * App Mesh gateway routes can be imported using `mesh_name` and `virtual_gateway_name` together with the gateway route's `name`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:appmesh/gatewayRoute:GatewayRoute example mesh/gw1/example-gateway-route
 * ```
