/**
 * Subset of `Route` types that can be passed in as an `Output` to the API.  These Route types will
 * not themselves cause other Resources to be created.
 *
 * Unlike `routes`, these can be provided as an `Output` of an `array` instead of having to just be
 * an `array`. However, because they can be `Output`s, they are restricted to a subset of `Route`
 * types that will not cause resources to be created.
 *
 * This can be useful, for example, when creating an API that needs to create an indeterminate
 * number of integration-routes based on the `Output` of some other resource.  For example:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const additionalRoutes = elasticBeanstalkEnvironment.loadBalancers.apply(lbs =>
 *   lbs.map(arn => <awsx.apigateway.IntegrationRoute>{
 *     path: "/greeting",
 *     method: "GET",
 *     target: {
 *         type: "http_proxy",
 *         uri: `http://${aws.lb.getLoadBalancer({ arn }).dnsName}`,
 *     }
 *   }));
 *
 * const api = new awsx.apigateway.API("apiName", { additionalRoutes });
 * ```
 *
 * In this example computing all of the individual `additionalRoutes` depends on the individual
 * array values in `elasticBeanstalkEnvironment.loadBalancers` (which is itself an `Output`).  These
 * could not normally be converted into the reified `Route[]` array since computing a value off of
 * an `Output` produces yet another `Output`.  `routes` itself cannot be an `Output` because it will
 * often create additional AWS resources, and creating those resources dependent on some other
 * resource value would mean not being able to create and present a preview plan because the actual
 * resources created would depend on previous resources.
 *
 * So `additionalRoutes` serves as a way to bridge both approaches.  `Routes` is used when the
 * values are known up-front (or when it would cause Resources to be created).  `additionalRoutes`
 * is used when values are not a-priori known, and when they will not create additional Resources
 * themselves.
