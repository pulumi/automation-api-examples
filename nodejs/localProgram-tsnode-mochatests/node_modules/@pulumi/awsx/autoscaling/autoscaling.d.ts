     * With target tracking scaling policies, you select a scaling metric and set a target value.
     * Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling creates and manages the CloudWatch alarms that trigger the scaling
     * policy and calculates the scaling adjustment based on the metric and the target value. The
     * scaling policy adds or removes capacity as required to keep the metric at, or close to, the
     * specified target value. In addition to keeping the metric close to the target value, a target
     * tracking scaling policy also adjusts to the changes in the metric due to a changing load
     * pattern.
     *
     * For example, you can use target tracking scaling to:
     *
     * * Configure a target tracking scaling policy to keep the average aggregate CPU utilization of
     *   your Auto Scaling group at 50 percent.
     *
     * * Configure a target tracking scaling policy to keep the request count per target of your
     *   Elastic Load Balancing target group at 1000 for your Auto Scaling group.
     *
     * We recommend that you scale on Amazon EC2 instance metrics with a 1-minute frequency because
     * that ensures a faster response to utilization changes. Scaling on metrics with a 5-minute
     * frequency can result in slower response times and scaling on stale metric data. By default,
     * Amazon EC2 instances are enabled for basic monitoring, which means metric data for instances
     * is available at 5-minute intervals. You can enable detailed monitoring to get metric data for
     * instances at 1-minute frequency. For more information, see
     * [Configure-Monitoring-for-Auto-Scaling-Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-instance-monitoring.html#enable-as-instance-metrics).
