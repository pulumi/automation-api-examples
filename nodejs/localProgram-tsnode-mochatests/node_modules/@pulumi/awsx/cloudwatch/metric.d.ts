/**
 * Metrics are the fundamental concept in CloudWatch. A metric represents a time-ordered set of data
 * points that are published to CloudWatch. Think of a metric as a variable to monitor, and the data
 * points as representing the values of that variable over time. For example, the CPU usage of a
 * particular EC2 instance is one metric provided by Amazon EC2. The data points themselves can come
 * from any application or business activity from which you collect data.
 *
 * AWS services send metrics to CloudWatch, and you can send your own custom metrics to CloudWatch.
 * You can add the data points in any order, and at any rate you choose. You can retrieve statistics
 * about those data points as an ordered set of time-series data.
 *
 * Metrics exist only in the region in which they are created. Metrics cannot be deleted, but they
 * automatically expire after 15 months if no new data is published to them. Data points older than
 * 15 months expire on a rolling basis; as new data points come in, data older than 15 months is
 * dropped.
 *
 * Metrics are uniquely defined by a name, a namespace, and zero or more dimensions. Each data point
 * in a metric has a time stamp, and (optionally) a unit of measure. You can retrieve statistics
 * from CloudWatch for any metric.
 *
 * see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_concepts.html#Metric
 * for more details.
