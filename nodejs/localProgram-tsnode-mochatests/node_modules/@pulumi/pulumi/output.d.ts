 *
 * In other words, this should not be used as the shape of an object: `{ a: Promise<Output<...>> }`.

/**
 * [Output] helps encode the relationship between Resources in a Pulumi application. Specifically an
 * [Output] holds onto a piece of Data and the Resource it was generated from. An [Output] value can
 * then be provided when constructing new Resources, allowing that new Resource to know both the
 * value as well as the Resource the value came from.  This allows for a precise 'Resource
 * dependency graph' to be created, which properly tracks the relationship between resources.
 *
 * An [Output] is used in a Pulumi program differently depending on if the application is executing
 * at 'deployment time' (i.e. when actually running the 'pulumi' executable), or at 'run time' (i.e.
 * a piece of code running in some Cloud).
 *
 * At 'deployment time', the correct way to work with the underlying value is to call
 * [Output.apply(func)].  This allows the value to be accessed and manipulated, while still
 * resulting in an [Output] that is keeping track of [Resource]s appropriately.  At deployment time
 * the underlying value may or may not exist (for example, if a preview is being performed).  In
 * this case, the 'func' callback will not be executed, and calling [.apply] will immediately return
 * an [Output] that points to the [undefined] value.  During a normal [update] though, the 'func'
 * callbacks should always be executed.
 *
 * At 'run time', the correct way to work with the underlying value is to simply call [Output.get]
 * which will be promptly return the entire value.  This will be a simple JavaScript object that can
 * be manipulated as necessary.
 *
 * To ease with using [Output]s at 'deployment time', pulumi will 'lift' simple data properties of
 * an underlying value to the [Output] itself.  For example:
 *
 * ```ts
 *      const o: Output<{ name: string, age: number, orders: Order[] }> = ...;
 *      const name : Output<string> = o.name;
 *      const age  : Output<number> = o.age;
 *      const first: Output<Order>  = o.orders[0];
 * ```
 *
 * Instead of having to write:
 *
 * ```ts
 *      const o: Output<{ name: string, age: number, orders: Order[] }> = ...;
 *      const name : Output<string> = o.apply(v => v.name);
 *      const age  : Output<number> = o.apply(v => v.age);
